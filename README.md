# 📝 ToDoListApp

This is a **React Native** To-Do List application developed using the [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), with state management handled via [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/introduction). It allows users to manage their daily tasks with a sleek and responsive UI based on **Material Design principles**.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Add Tasks** – Users can input and add new tasks.
- ❌ **Delete Tasks** – Tasks can be removed from the list.
- ✔️ **Mark Tasks as Complete** – Tasks can be marked complete with visual indicators like strikethrough.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**  – Tasks are saved locally using [AsyncStorage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage) for data persistence.
